  "intro": "The country has vast untapped and undiscovered gold reverses within the six (6) major gold belts that run across the country. These belts are the Lawra Belt, Bole-Navrongo Belt, Sefwi Belt, Asankrangwa Belt, Ashanti Belt, and Kibi-Winneba Belt. Indigenous mining of gold in Ghana dates as far back as the 4th century and has sustained modern large-scale mechanized mining for over 100 years. In 2019, Ghana's total gold was 4.577 million ounces; the small-scale sector accounted for 35 percent, with the large scale producers contributing the remaining 65 percent in 2019 (Ghana Chamber of Mines, 2019). All these outputs are by the private sector industry only. Certainly this is an indication of an enabling environment in Ghana’s mine industry.",
  "projectDescription1": "The proposed project will be on the firm’s 8.44Km2 concession at Awaham in the West Akim Municipal Assembly of the Eastern Region of Ghana. The concession has a proven reserve of 5700,000m3 of alluvial gold ore deposition with an average grade of 0.5g/m3 and an estimated gold reserve of 91,639 ounces. The analysis of gold produced from the concession shows a gold purity of 92% or 22 karats in its natural state. Also found in association with the alluvial gold is economic quantities of ilmenite (FeTiO3), a source of ore used in the production of titanium (Ti).\n\nThe proponents of Bugudon Gold Mine are seeking to harness and test the proven and unproven mineral potential of the project by implementing a four (4) phase operation. The phases are designed as follows:\n\n1. Phase 1: Exploitation of alluvial gold and ilmenite with a 500m3 alluvial gold and ilmenite plant. The thought process here is to tap into the established commercial quantities of mineralization to ensure production and cash flow within year 1;\n2. Phase 2: Hard rock exploration to work is to establish or debunk the idea that the concession has economic quantities of hard rock gold and ilmenite;\n3. Phase 3: Installation and running a CIL plant and Ilmenite Gravity Separation Plant, this phase will be dependent on the success of phase 2 or the establishment of commercial quantities of hard rock gold and ilmenite;\n4. Phase 4: Installation and running TiO2 Plant to convert about 80% of expected ilmenite produce on-site into titanium dioxide as a value-added product for export.",
  "projectDescription2": "The proposed project will be on the firm’s 19.11Km2 concession at Wamase in the West Akim Municipal Assembly of the Eastern Region of Ghana. The concession has a proven reserve of 10,060,000m3 of alluvial gold ore deposition with an average grade of 0.5g/m3 and an estimated gold reserve of 161,736ounces. The analysis of gold produced from the concession shows a gold purity of 92% or 22 karats in its natural state.

  "projectDescription3": "The proposed project will be on the firm’s 31.89Km2 concession at Moseaso, Asankragwa, in the Amenfi District Assembly of the Western Region of Ghana. The Concession has an independent geological report by SEMS Exploration, Ghana a member of the West African Consultancy group. The report is in compliance of (‘‘JORC Code’’) and (‘‘ VALMIN Code’’). The report indicates a vast potential for alluvial gold deposits and recommends the explorations for hard rock gold deposits as the potentials exists.Wenof is therefore seeking a potential investor to undertake the detailed exploration of the alluvial deposits as well as the hard rock potential. We are open to loan investment finances on explorations joint partners.",
